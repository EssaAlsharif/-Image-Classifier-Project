# Flower Image Classifier

This project implements an image classifier for different species of flowers using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub. The model is trained on the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset and is capable of predicting the species from an input image. The project includes training, evaluation, and an inference script.

## Project Overview

- Trains a neural network using transfer learning (MobileNet v3 via TensorFlow Hub) to classify flower species.
- Includes Jupyter Notebook for training and experimentation.
- Provides a command-line tool (`predict.py`) for image inference.
- Achieves over 70% accuracy on the test set.

## Dataset

- [Oxford 102 Flower Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html)
- 102 flower categories, split into train, validation, and test sets.
